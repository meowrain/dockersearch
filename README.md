"full_description": "# Bitnami package for MySQL ## What is MySQL? > MySQL is a fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use open source relational database system. Designed to handle mission-critical, heavy-load production applications. [Overview of MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) Trademarks: This software listing is packaged by Bitnami. The respective trademarks mentioned in the offering are owned by the respective companies, and use of them does not imply any affiliation or endorsement. ## TL;DR ```console docker run --name mysql -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes bitnami/mysql:latest ``` ## Why use Bitnami Images? * Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems. * With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible. * Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs. * All our images are based on [**minideb**](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) -a minimalist Debian based container image that gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution- or **scratch** -an explicitly empty image-. * All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Notation](https://notaryproject.dev/). [Check this post](https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/03/bitnami-packaged-containers-and-helm.html) to know how to verify the integrity of the images. * Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available. Looking to use MySQL in production? Try [VMware Tanzu Application Catalog](https://bitnami.com/enterprise), the commercial edition of the Bitnami catalog. ## How to deploy MySQL in Kubernetes? Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami MySQL Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mysql). Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. ## Why use a non-root container? Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-work-with-non-root-containers-index.html). ## Only latest stable branch maintained in the free Bitnami catalog Starting December 10th 2024, only the latest stable branch of any container will receive updates in the free Bitnami catalog. To access up-to-date releases for all upstream-supported branches, consider upgrading to Bitnami Premium. Previous versions already released will not be deleted. They are still available to pull from DockerHub. Please check the Bitnami Premium page in our partner [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/globalecs/na/vendors/bitnami?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=containers) for more information. ## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/application-catalog/tanzu-application-catalog/services/tac-doc/apps-tutorials-understand-rolling-tags-containers-index.html). You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`. Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers). ## Get this image The recommended way to get the Bitnami MySQL Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mysql). ```console docker pull bitnami/mysql:latest ``` To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mysql/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry. ```console docker pull bitnami/mysql:[TAG] ``` If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values. ```console git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest . ``` ## Persisting your database If you remove the container all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed. For persistence you should mount a directory at the `/bitnami/mysql/data` path. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run. ```console docker run \ -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \ -v /path/to/mysql-persistence:/bitnami/mysql/data \ bitnami/mysql:latest ``` or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mysql/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository: ```yaml services: mysql: ... volumes: - /path/to/mysql-persistence:/bitnami/mysql/data ... ``` > NOTE: As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`. ## Connecting to other containers Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a MySQL server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers. Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname. ### Using the Command Line In this example, we will create a MySQL client instance that will connect to the server instance that is running on the same docker network as the client. #### Step 1: Create a network ```console docker network create app-tier --driver bridge ``` #### Step 2: Launch the MySQL server instance Use the `--network app-tier` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the MySQL container to the `app-tier` network. ```console docker run -d --name mysql-server \ -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \ --network app-tier \ bitnami/mysql:latest ``` #### Step 3: Launch your MySQL client instance Finally we create a new container instance to launch the MySQL client and connect to the server created in the previous step: ```console docker run -it --rm \ --network app-tier \ bitnami/mysql:latest mysql -h mysql-server -u root ``` ### Using a Docker Compose file When not specified, Docker Compose automatically sets up a new network and attaches all deployed services to that network. However, we will explicitly define a new `bridge` network named `app-tier`. In this example we assume that you want to connect to the MySQL server from your own custom application image which is identified in the following snippet by the service name `myapp`. ```yaml version: '2' networks: app-tier: driver: bridge services: mysql: image: 'bitnami/mysql:latest' environment: - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes networks: - app-tier myapp: image: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE' networks: - app-tier ``` > **IMPORTANT**: > > 1. Please update the `YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE` placeholder in the above snippet with your application image > 2. In your application container, use the hostname `mysql` to connect to the MySQL server Launch the containers using: ```console docker-compose up -d ``` ## Configuration ### Environment variables #### Customizable environment variables | Name | Description | Default Value | |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------| | `ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD` | Allow MySQL access without any password. | `no` | | `MYSQL_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN` | MySQL authentication plugin to configure during the first initialization. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_ROOT_USER` | MySQL database root user. | `root` | | `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` | MySQL database root user password. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_USER` | MySQL database user to create during the first initialization. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | Password for the MySQL database user to create during the first initialization. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_DATABASE` | MySQL database to create during the first initialization. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_MASTER_HOST` | Address for the MySQL master node. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_MASTER_PORT_NUMBER` | Port number for the MySQL master node. | `3306` | | `MYSQL_MASTER_ROOT_USER` | MySQL database root user of the master host. | `root` | | `MYSQL_MASTER_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Password for the MySQL database root user of the the master host. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_MASTER_DELAY` | MySQL database replication delay. | `0` | | `MYSQL_REPLICATION_USER` | MySQL replication database user. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD` | Password for the MySQL replication database user. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_PORT_NUMBER` | Port number to use for the MySQL Server service. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_REPLICATION_MODE` | MySQL replication mode. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_REPLICATION_SLAVE_DUMP` | Make a dump on master and update slave MySQL database | `false` | | `MYSQL_EXTRA_FLAGS` | Extra flags to be passed to start the MySQL Server. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_INIT_SLEEP_TIME` | Sleep time when waiting for MySQL init configuration operations to finish. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_CHARACTER_SET` | MySQL collation to use. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_COLLATE` | MySQL collation to use. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_BIND_ADDRESS` | MySQL bind address. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_SQL_MODE` | MySQL Server SQL modes to enable. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_UPGRADE` | MySQL upgrade option. | `AUTO` | | `MYSQL_IS_DEDICATED_SERVER` | Whether the MySQL Server will run on a dedicated node. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_CLIENT_ENABLE_SSL` | Whether to force SSL for connections to the MySQL database. | `no` | | `MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL_CA_FILE` | Path to CA certificate to use for SSL connections to the MySQL database server. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL_CERT_FILE` | Path to client public key certificate to use for SSL connections to the MySQL database server. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL_KEY_FILE` | Path to client private key to use for SSL connections to the MySQL database server. | `nil` | | `MYSQL_CLIENT_EXTRA_FLAGS` | Whether to force SSL connections with the "mysql" CLI tool.

Files with extensions `.sh`, `.sql` and `.sql.gz` are supported. * Files in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` will only execute on the first container start. * Files in `/docker-entrypoint-startdb.d` will execute on every container start. In order to have your custom files inside the docker image you can mount them as a volume. Take into account those scripts are treated differently depending on the extension. While the `.sh` scripts are executed in all the nodes; the `.sql` and `.sql.gz` scripts are only executed in the master nodes. The reason behind this differentiation is that the `.sh` scripts allow adding conditions to determine what is the node running the script, while these conditions can't be set using `.sql` nor `sql.gz` files. This way it is possible to cover different use cases depending on their needs. > NOTE: If you are importing large databases, it is recommended to import them as `.sql` instead of `.sql.gz`, as the latter one needs to be decompressed on the fly and not allowing for additional optimizations to import large files. ### Setting the root password on first run The root user and password can easily be setup with the Bitnami MySQL Docker image using the following environment variables: * `MYSQL_ROOT_USER`: The database admin user. Defaults to `root`. * `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: The database admin user password. No defaults. Passing the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable when running the image for the first time will set the password of the `MYSQL_ROOT_USER` user to the value of `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`. ```console docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password123 bitnami/mysql:latest ``` or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mysql/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository: ```yaml services: mysql: ... environment: - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password123 ... ``` **Warning** The `MYSQL_ROOT_USER` user is always created with remote access. It's suggested that the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` env variable is always specified to set a password for the `MYSQL_ROOT_USER` user. In case you want to allow the `MYSQL_ROOT_USER` user to access the database without a password set the environment variable `ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes`. **This is recommended only for development**. ### Allowing empty passwords By default the MySQL image expects all the available passwords to be set. In order to allow empty passwords, it is necessary to set the `ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes` env variable. This env variable is only recommended for testing or development purposes. We strongly recommend specifying the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` for any other scenario. ```console docker run --name mysql -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes bitnami/mysql:latest ``` or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mysql/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository: ```yaml services: mysql: ... environment: - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes ... ``` ### Setting character set and collation It is possible to configure the character set and collation used by default by the database with the following environment variables: * `MYSQL_CHARACTER_SET`: The default character set to use. Default: `utf8` * `MYSQL_COLLATE`: The default collation to use. Default: `utf8_general_ci` ### Creating a database on first run By passing the `MYSQL_DATABASE` environment variable when running the image for the first time, a database will be created. This is useful if your application requires that a database already exists, saving you from having to manually create the database using the MySQL client. ```console docker run --name mysql \ -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database \ bitnami/mysql:latest ``` or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mysql/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository: ```yaml services: mysql: ... environment: - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes - MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database ... ``` ### Creating a database user on first run You can create a restricted database user that only has permissions for the database created with the [`MYSQL_DATABASE`](#creating-a-database-on-first-run) environment variable. To do this, provide the `MYSQL_USER` environment variable and to set a password for the database user provide the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` variable. MySQL supports different authentication mechanisms, such as `caching_sha2_password` or `mysql_native_password`. To set it, use the `MYSQL_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN` variable. ```console docker run --name mysql \ -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \ -e MYSQL_USER=my_user \ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=my_password \ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database \ -e MYSQL_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN=mysql_native_password \ bitnami/mysql:latest ``` or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mysql/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository: ```yaml services: mysql: ... environment: - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes - MYSQL_USER=my_user - MYSQL_PASSWORD=my_password - MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database ... ``` **Note!** The `root` user will be created with remote access and without a password if `ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD` is enabled. Please provide the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` env variable instead if you want to set a password for the `root` user. ### Setting up a replication cluster A **zero downtime** MySQL master-slave [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-options.html) cluster can easily be setup with the Bitnami MySQL Docker image using the following environment variables: * `MYSQL_REPLICATION_MODE`: The replication mode. Possible values `master`/`slave`. No defaults. * `MYSQL_REPLICATION_USER`: The replication user created on the master on first run. No defaults. * `MYSQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD`: The replication users password. No defaults. * `MYSQL_MASTER_HOST`: Hostname/IP of replication master (slave parameter). No defaults. * `MYSQL_MASTER_PORT_NUMBER`: Server port of the replication master (slave parameter). Defaults to `3306`. * `MYSQL_MASTER_ROOT_USER`: User on replication master with access to `MYSQL_DATABASE` (slave parameter). Defaults to `root` * `MYSQL_MASTER_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Password of user on replication master with access to `MYSQL_DATABASE` (slave parameter). No defaults. * `MYSQL_MASTER_DELAY`: The database replication delay (slave parameter). Defaults to `0`. In a replication cluster you can have one master and zero or more slaves. When replication is enabled the master node is in read-write mode, while the slaves are in read-only mode. For best performance its advisable to limit the reads to the slaves. #### Step 1: Create the replication master The first step is to start the MySQL master. ```console docker run --name mysql-master \ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=master_root_password \ -e MYSQL_REPLICATION_MODE=master \ -e MYSQL_REPLICATION_USER=my_repl_user \ -e MYSQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD=my_repl_password \ -e MYSQL_USER=my_user \ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=my_password \ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=my_database \ bitnami/mysql:latest ``` In the above command the container is configured as the `master` using the `MYSQL_REPLICATION_MODE` parameter. A replication user is specified using the `MYSQL_REPLICATION_USER` and `MYSQL_REPLICATION_PASSWORD` parameters. #### Step 2: Create the replication slave Next we start a MySQL slave container. ```console docker run --name mysql-slave --link mysql-master:master \ -e MYSQL_REPLICATION_MODE=slave \ -e MYSQL_REPLICATION _Note: the README for this container is longer than the DockerHub length limit of 25000, so it has been trimmed. The full README can be found at https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mysql/README.md_",
